You only want to socialize (But I don't think we should)

Shout startling, shrilly screams
They'll sneak from their sarcophagus
And just won't leave you be

Ya actin' like a diva, sayin' you don't wanna pay
It's gotta be ya feisty style, raised eyebrow
I love it when you look at me that way
Now we're in, you order a mojito at the bar
You reapply lippy 'cause it came off on the glass
The DJ plays your favorite songs, Kanye's on
Now ya beckoning for me to dance

Mm, pullin' me, pullin' me, pullin' me close
Just close your eyes, girl
Whispering, tellin' me we gotta go
Won't you take me home? I wanna—

But even then, I knew

Taught me all about dynamics
He was twenty-three
And I was thirteen, going on thirty
We spent hours strumming the lute
Striking the chords and blowing the flute
He plucked my strings all the way to G
Went from major to minor, C to D

Gets what he wants and he won't take no

Helped him in his office, had a duty to fulfill
He even let me use his favorite quill
Spilled ink all over the parchment
My wrist was so tired
Still, I came back the next day as he required

So I decided to have a break from boys
And you'll never guess who I met!

Tall, large, Henry VIII
Supreme head of the Church of England
Globally revered
Although you wouldn't know it from the look of that beard
Made me a lady-in-waiting, held
Me and my family up in the world
Gave me duties in court and he swears it's true
That, without me, he doesn't know what he'd do
You say, I'm all you need
All you want, we both agree
This is the place for me
I'm finally where I'm meant to be
Then he starts saying all this stuff
He cares so much, he calls me ""Love""
He says we have this connection
I guess it's not so different
'Cause, all you wanna do
All you wanna do, baby
Is touch me, love me, can't get enough, see
All you wanna do

The only thing you wanna do is... mwah

So we got married. .. . . woo!

With Henry, it isn't easy
His temper's short and his mates are sleazy
Except for this one courtier
He's a really nice guy, just so sincere
The royal life isn't what I planned
But Thomas is there to lend a helping hand
So sweet, makes sure that I'm okay
And we hang out loads when the King's away
This guy, finally
Is what I want, the friend I need
Just mates, no chemistry
I get him and he gets me
And there's nothing more to it
He just cares so much, he's devoted
He says we have a connection
I thought this time was different
Why did I think he'd be different?
But it's never, ever different
'Cause, all you wanna do
All you wanna do, baby
Is touch me, when will enough be enough, see?
All you wanna do
All you wanna do, baby
Is squeeze me, don't care if you don't please me

Hungry for the histories they show me
All my life I memorize their faces
Knowing them as they will never know me
All my life I wonder how it feels to pass a day
Not above them
But part of them
And out there, living in the sun
Give me one day out there, all I ask is one
To hold forever, out there
Where they all live unaware
What I'd give, what I'd dare
Just to live one day out there!
Out there among the millers and the weavers and their wives
Through the roofs and gables I can see them
Every day they shout and scold and go about their lives
Heedless of the gift it is to be them
If I were in their skin, I'd treasure every instant
Out there, strolling by the Seine
Taste a morning out there, like ordinary men
Who freely walk about there
Just one day and then I swear I'll be content
With my share
Won't resent
Won't despair
Old and bent
I won't care

But then I spent so many nights thinkin' how you did me wrong
And I grew strong, and I learned how to get along

And so you're back, from outer space
I just walked in to find you here with that sad look upon your face
I should have changed that stupid lock
I should have made you leave your key
If I'd have known for just one second you'd be back to bother me

Go on now, go, walk out the door
Just turn around now, 'cause you're not welcome anymore
Weren't you the one who tried to hurt me with goodbye?
Did you think I'd crumble? Did you think I'd lay down and die?

Oh no, not I, I will survive
Oh, as long as I know how to love, I know I'm still alive
I've got all my life to live, and I've got all my love to give
And I'll survive, I will survive, hey hey


It took all the strength I had, not to fall apart
Just tryin' hard to mend the pieces of my broken heart
And I spent oh so many nights just feeling sorry for myself
I used to cry, but now I hold my head up high
And you see me, somebody new
I'm not that chained up little person still in love with you
And so you felt like droppin' in and just expect me to be free
Well, now I'm saving all my lovin' for someone who's lovin' me

Go on now, go, walk out the door
Just turn around now, 'cause you're not welcome anymore
Weren't you the one who tried to break me with goodbye?
Did you think I'd crumble? Did you think I'd lay down and die?

Oh no, not I, I will survive
Oh, as long as I know how to love, I know I'm still alive
I've got all my life to live, and I've got all my love to give

Es ist nicht dasselbe, wenn es so nah ist
Lass es regnen, ich lass es schneien
Sie arbeitet mit der Stange, ich habe die Banknoten

Ein Patron on the Rocks, der dich zum Stöhnen bringt
Ein Stapel komm schon, zwei Stapel komm schon
Drei Stapel komm schon, das sind jetzt drei Riesen
Glaubst du, ich mache Witze, Baby Girl?
Ich bin der Mann, ich erfand die Gummibänder
Das hab ich ihr gesagt, ihre Beine auf meiner Schulter
Ich wusste, es war vorbei, diese Henny und Cola
Haben mich wie einen Soldaten, sie ist bereit für Rover

Ja, sie war das Geld wert
Kleine Mama nahm mein Geld und ich will es nicht zurück
So wie sie den Rücken gebogen hat, hat sie diese Papierstapel
Tattoo über ihrer Ritze, das musste ich erledigen
Ich war drauf, sexy Frau
Sie zeigte es mir und brachte mich dazu, es zu wollen
Zwei Uhr morgens, ich bin am Abdrehen und die Rosflaschen schäumen
Sie wollte nicht aufhören, ließ es fallen

You'd come over and you'd stay the night
Would you love me for the hell of it?

And there wouldn't be a reason why
We would even have to say goodbye

Believe that
How are you doing?
Alright
So, Eazy, tell me, how was your life as a youngster?

Ruthless, my style as a juvenile
Ran with a gang, slanged in the meanwhile
Bankin', I specialized in gankin'
Whites, Mexicans, brothers and others
Daily, it's all about comin' up
Makin' sure no punks are runnin' up
Because I'm a gangsta havin' fun​
Strapped with a gat when I'm walkin' through Compton
Terrible, I never listened to my mother
It went in one ear and out the other
Ran my gang, sold undercover
Call a girl out her name, yo, I ain't no lover
I'm a pimp, mack daddy, lookin' for the dollar
At thirteen I bought a '6-4 Impala
Rollin' and runnin' from the police
Brother, don't you know you can't trust a thief
Or thug, convict, hoodlum or criminal?
Leave your car open, gank for your stereo
Hard and raw, no regard for the law
Eazy-E, were you ever caught slipping? Hell nah
Just trippin' off 8-ball
And girls ain't nothin' but female dogs to me
Bitches, I'm sorry for that verse
It's in my nature, I gotta curse
Out anybody gettin' on my nerves
You get beat, ganked, broke and served
So you know who I am
And if you don't like it, I really don't give a damn

Hmm, I see, so you're rather violent?
Sometimes
Okay, what would be the situation when you so-call ""gank"" someone?
Waitin' for some people to leave
I got another trick up my sleeve
Step with pep to the back of the house
Looked in, all the lights are out
Grabbed the door and it's locked, so
Easily made my way to the window
Lift it up slow 'cause it takes timing
Looked around and then I climbed in
Once inside, I start takin'
'Cause you know, it's no time for shakin'
Get what you gonna get, front and center
Or get five years for breakin' and enter
Move quickly, but no runnin'
Shh, I think somebody's comin'
Hear the front door key and I flee
Out the back with a fist full of jewelry
Over the wall, don't fall
Wipe my sweat 'cause that was a close call
Gettin' ganked by the E is a lesson
So is there any more questions?

Yes, as a matter of fact, there is
Have you ever been involved in, like, an armed robbery or a hold-up?
You mean a two-eleven?
Yeah

There's a store, but don't point
Walk inside, case the joint
One man behind the counter, another in the back
Go out to the car and load the gat
Grabbed the ski mask, here's the task
Go in broke, come out with cash
Were you slick? Yeah, you gotta be cunnin'
Told Ice Cube to leave the car runnin'
Walked in, said, ""This is a robbery""
Didn't need the money, it's just a hobby
Fill the bag, homeboy, don't lag
I want money, beer, and a pack of Zig-Zags
The man in the back had a camera
So he came out to test his stamina
Against Eazy-E, but he took one
Fell to the floor, so I run
Back to the bucket, then I said, ""Punch it""
Took the gun and then dumped it
I'm not like Robin Hood, 'cause I want more
Steal from the rich, hang with the poor
My pockets are fat, you see, it don't matter to me
I feel like nobody is badder than me
Is all that true? I don't lie
You see, I'm not Mr. Nice Guy

Oh, so you're not exactly a role model?
Not exactly
And for your listeners, what does Eazy-E think of himself?

Bad and bold, you can't get with this
Those that tried, you're on my shit list
Can't be caught, sought or fought
Taught, and damn sure bought
Down and dirty from the CPT
N.W.A and Eazy-E
One more, before we end this session
What's your real age? No more questions",0

I think about that day
I left him at a Greyhound station
West of Santa Fé
We were seventeen, but he was sweet and it was true
Still I did what I had to do
'Cause I just knew
Summer; Sunday nights
We'd sink into our seats
Right as they dimmed out all the lights
A Technicolor world made out of music and machine
It called me to be on that screen
And live inside each scene

Without a nickel to my name
Hopped a bus, here I came
Could be brave or just insane

We'll have to see

'Cause maybe in that sleepy town
He'll sit one day, the lights are down
He'll see my face and think of how he...

...used to know me

Climb these hills
I'm reaching for the heights
And chasing all the lights that shine
And when they let you down
You'll get up off the ground
'Cause morning rolls around
And it's another day of sun

I hear 'em ev'ry day
The rhythms in the canyons
That'll never fade away
The ballads in the barrooms
Left by those who came before
They say ""you gotta want it more""
So I bang on ev'ry door

And even when the answer's ""no""
Or when my money's running low
The dusty mic and neon glow
Are all I need

And someday as I sing my song
A small-town kid'll come along

That'll be the thing to push him on and go go

Climb these hills
I'm reaching for the heights
And chasing all the lights that shine
And when they let you down
You'll get up off the ground
'Cause morning rolls around
And it's another day of sun


And when they let you down
The morning rolls around
It's another day of sun
It's another day of sun
It's another day of sun
It's another day of sun
Just another day of sun
It's another day of sun
Another day has just begun

For taking you in and letting you win control of my heart
(I've been such a fool)
And every single time you make your way into my sheets
The hours move to minutes, the days turn into weeks

Oh, I know all about your type
You're the type of girl that texts all day and talks all night
And, oh, I know that you are feeling sad
I don't feel bad
'Cause even after three text messages, four missed calls
You still slept with my best friend",0

I'm more concerned with commas
Than keeping up with you
Keep that away from me

Make the fool come out like, ""Who is he?""

Miał czarną, skórzaną ramoneskę (Hej)
Złą reputację, nienasycone zwyczaje
Był on mną zauroczony, jedno spojrzenie i nie mogłam oddychać, tak
Powiedział, że jeśli mnie pocałuje, mogłabym na to pozwolić (Och-o-och)

Przysięgam za me życie, że byłam miłą dziewczyną (Och-o-och)

Jestem tym typem, który może ją uwieść dla tatusia (Och, tak)
DaBaby sprawi, że zapomni, czego się nauczyła od swojego tatusia 
Nie chcę się mylić dla maleńkiej panienki, pozwalam jej robić to, co ona pragnie
Nie chcę całować tej małej panienki, zarówno ona nie chce mnie całować
Przyszła z Tobą, a potem wyszła ze mną
Miałem punkt zwrotny, możemy go nawet nazwać (Tak, tak)
Nie lubię bryki, w której ona jest, skończę na kupnie nowego Bimmera (Lecimy)
Ta dziewczyna wie, czego ona chce, sprawia, że chcę się rozebrać, kiedy mnie widzi (Lecimy)
Mówi, że sprawiam, że staje się mokra, kiedy tylko ma twarzyczka wyskoczy na wizji
Musiałem powiedzieć, ""Z brakiem nieuszanowania, muszę to zrobić bezpiecznie, albo możesz to zostawić""
Gwiazda popu, wyszedłem świeży z trapu i zamieniam się w Biebera
Wie, że oddzwaniam, może dać mi przypinkę, a ja mógłbym ją odwiedzić

I kochanie, życzę tego i chcę być po prostu szczery
Bo nie mogę udawać, kiedy na ciebie patrzę
Będę całkowicie szczery, kiedy wyrzucę te sto rachunków
Mam nadzieję, że twój tyłek wie, co robić

I went from rags to riches
I still go back to the trenches
We had to smash some niggas
No silver spoons, we had plastic utensils
He just came home, he still packin' his pistol
Die in these streets or get saved by the system
Or get you some millions, my lifestyle is vicious
These hoes ain't gon' miss you
They fuck on your partner, act like they forgot you, that shit have you sick
My girl, she the realest, I know how to pick 'em
I know what I did, I need you to bear with me
I know shit get ugly, but that's why you pretty
And pushin' a Bentley, my kind near extinct
I put up them millions, I'll never go broke
I'm a god in my hood, I give everyone hope
Can't remember a time when my answer was nope
I remember the times I had nowhere to go
Down to my lowest, I turned to a pro
And I'm pourin' my heart out, I bought my lil' boy house
I brought all the bros out, I never try show out
I'm never gon' go out, never that
Every time that I turn around, I'm giving back
Once they whack him, he's dead, it ain't no gettin' back
I was giving my all, not asking for it back
I had blue hearts at first, I had to turn 'em black

Ridin' around town in a big ol' Range
I knew her when I rocked big ol' jeans
Now the little nigga doin' big ol' thangs
Would you look at that? I came back for her
Just to give it to ya, like you asked for it
Man, that thing in them jeans too fat for her
Rebounds so I caught her off the backboard
I told her: “Baby girl, come here
Know I run the town even when I ain't from there.”
And I brag hardly, but just to show up at this party
I made what yo' nigga make in one year
That's unfair, but so is life, take a chance, roll the dice
Money can’t buy you love, 'cause it’s overpriced
Don’t overthink, just hope it's right
I’m only here for the night

They be startin' shit, but it’s yo' world
On my Martin shit: “You go, girl!”

Some niggas save hoes, I’m not that heroic
Could you be my escort?
'Cause just like them two door Fords
Damn, they don’t make 'em like you no more
Cole World, real Cole World
Them boys cool—me, I’m on fire
Know what's on my mind
Tryna see what's on yours tonight, tonight, tonight
Move slow, 'cause you wanna live fast
Up late so you'll probably skip class
Life is a test so before the night pass, get right, get right

Para-, para-, paradise
Para-, para-, paradise
Every time she closed her eyes

Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh

When she was just a girl
She expected the world
But it flew away from her reach
And the bullets catch in her teeth

Life goes on, it gets so heavy
The wheel breaks the butterfly
Every tear, a waterfall
In the night, the stormy night, she'd close her eyes
In the night, the stormy night, away she'd fly

And dream of para-, para-, paradise
Para-, para-, paradise
Para-, para-, paradise

Mr. Madison
Senator Burr
What is this?

We have the check stubs from separate accounts

Almost a thousand dollars, paid in different amounts

To a Mr. James Reynolds way back in 1791

Is that what you have? Are you done?
You are uniquely situated by virtue of your position

Though virtue is not a word I'd apply to this situation

To seek financial gain, to stray from your sacred mission

And the evidence suggests you've engaged in speculation

An immigrant embezzling our government funds

I can almost see the headline, your career is done

I hope you saved some money for your daughter and sons

Ya best g'wan run back where ya come from

Ha! You don't even know what you’re asking me to confess

Confess

You have nothing, I don't have to tell you anything at all
Unless

Unless

If I can prove that I never broke the law
Do you promise not to tell another soul what you saw?

No one else was in the room where it happened

Is that a yes?

Um, yes
""Dear Sir, I hope this letter finds you in good health
And in a prosperous enough position to put wealth
In the pockets of people like me, down on their luck
You see, that was my wife who you decided to""

What?!
She courted me
Escorted me to bed and when she had me in a corner
That's when Reynolds extorted me
For a sordid fee, I paid him quarterly
I may have mortally wounded my prospects
But my papers are orderly
As you can see, I kept a record of every check in my checkered history
Check it again against your list and see consistency
I never spent a cent that wasn't mine
You sent the dogs after my scent, that's fine
Yes, I have reasons for shame
But I have not committed treason and sullied my good name
As you can see, I have done nothing to provoke legal action
Are my answers to your satisfaction?

My God

Gentlemen, let's go

So?

The people won't know what we know

Burr
How do I know you won't use this against me the next time we go toe to toe?

No matter what I make, they never see mistakes
Makin' so much bread, I don't care that they're just being fake
They tell me they're below me, I act like I'm above
The people blend together but I would be lost without their love

Can you heal me? Have I gained too much?
When you become untouchable, you're unable to touch
Is there a real me? Pop the champagne
It hurts me just to think, and I don't do pain

Stayin' still, eyes closed
Let the world just pass me by
Pain pills, nice clothes
If I fall I think I'll fly
Touch me, Midas

I'm standing there
On a balcony in summer air
See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say, ""Hello""
Little did I know

That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet""
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you, ""Please don't go,"" and I said

Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say, ""Yes""

So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew
So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while, oh, oh

'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter
And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet""
But you were everything to me
I was begging you, ""Please don't go,"" and I said

Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say, ""Yes""
Romeo, save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel
This love is difficult, but it's real
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
It's a love story, baby, just say, ""Yes""

Oh, oh

But I got tired of waiting
Wondering if you were ever coming around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town

And I said, ""Romeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you, but you never come
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think""
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring, and said
""Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone
I love you and that's all I really know
I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress

Damn, baby
Just don't understand where we went wrong
I gave you my heart
I gave you my soul
I gave you—

As a matter of fact, I was the one who said I loved you first
It was about eight years ago, don't act like you don't know
We were sittin' at home in your mama's livin' room
'Cause we couldn't be alone
See, your mama knew I was somethin' else, she knew how I felt
Back then, we were in school and that's your favorite excuse
Growin' up, I was a fool and I can't lie, I'm missin' you
Listen and don't trip
I think I need a bottle with a genie in it

Here's my wish list
First one, I would create a heart-changin' love
Second one, I'll take yours and fill it all up
Third one, but I don't need a lot of wishes
'Cause I'll be okay if I get one

If I had one wish, we would be best friends
Love would never end, it would just begin
If I had one wish, you would be my boo
Promise to love you, trust me, I'll trust you
If I had one wish, we would run away
Makin' love all day, have us a baby
If I had one wish, I'll make you my whole life
And you'll be my wife, make it right this time
If I had one wish

One wish, one wish, one wish
One wish, one wish, one wish
One wish, one wish, one wish
One wish, one wish, one wish

Now, tell me, is this the only way I can get you right back in?
If so, then searchin' I'll go, then I can have you for sho
Then you'll be lovin' me, holdin' me, kissin' me
So girl, don't tell me what I'm feelin' is make-believe
I swear, if I lose a second chance with you
I wouldn't know what to do
I'll probably check myself into some kind of clinic
I couldn't be alone because without you, I'm sick

And, even though we are grown, girl, I just want you to know

If I had one wish, we would be best friends

Because it makes You feel so strong (Safe)
Don't have much strength to fight
So I look to the light (War)
To make these wrongs turn right
Head up high, I look to the light
Hey, 'cause I know that You'll make everything alright
And I know that You'll take good care of Your child
Oh, no longer am afraid of the night
'Cause I, I look to the light

When they come for You, I will shield Your name
I will field their questions, I will feel Your pain
No one can judge
They don't, they don't know
They don't know

Foot on the Devil's neck 'til it drifted, Pangaea
I'm moving all my family from Chatham to Zambia
Treat the demons just like Pam
I mean, I fuck with your friends, but damn, Gina
I been this way since Arthur was anteater
Now they wanna hit me with the woo wap, the bam
Tryna snap photos of familia
My daughter look just like Sia, you can't see her
You can feel the lyrics, the spirit coming in braille
Tubman of the underground, come and follow the trail
I made “Sunday Candy,” I'm never going to hell
I met Kanye West, I'm never going to fail
He said, ""Let's do a good ass job with 'Chance 3'""
I hear you gotta sell it to snatch the Grammy
Let's make it so free and the bars so hard
That there ain't one gosh darn part you can't tweet
This is my part, nobody else speak
This is my part, nobody else speak
This little light of mine
Glory be to God, yeah
I'ma make sure that they go where they can't go
If they don't wanna ride, I'ma still give 'em raincoats
Know what God said when He made the first rainbow
Just throw this at the end if I'm too late for the intro
Ugh, I'm just having fun with it
You know that a nigga was lost
I laugh in my head
'Cause I bet that my ex looking back like a pillar of salt
Ugh, 'cause they'll flip the script on your ass like Wesley and Spike
You cannot mess with the light
Look at lil' Chano from 79th

We on an ultralight beam
We on an ultralight beam
This is a God dream
This is a God dream
This is everything
Everything

(Yes, God)
(Hallelujah)
I'm tryna keep my faith
(Yes, Jesus)
But I'm looking for more
Somewhere I can feel safe
And end my holy war
Father, this prayer is for everyone that feels they're not good enough
This prayer's for everybody that feel that they're too messed up
For everyone that feels they've said ""I'm sorry"" too many times
You can never go too far when you can't come back home again
That's why I need...
Faith, more, safe, war",3

I'm focused, man (DarkChild)
You should know this, man

Just one dose of me will have you addicted
To know me is to love me; I handle my business
Any city any town - touch down; I do my thing
I'm a hustler, baby, I provide by any means
I'm a great conversationist, you should know what I'm about
When you look at me baby you should see a way out
Out the hood, out the drama, out the Bentley that's on
Out the headache an stress you done been through before

It's only been three months and I already got it bad
So hood that I keep on coming back
My girlfriend's telling me I don't know how to act
But I'm telling them, ""Baby, bye, fall back""
He's so good and he knows how to love me
But so hood and he's so heavy in the streets
He's my dude and you better get used to things
And I don't care what you say about me
They say

That he does it with the best, runs it in the west
Tatted on his chest (Uh-huh)
I like it (So what?), I like it
And they say (That he's gonna hurt me)
Just wait and see (But they don't know me)
'Cause I am what he wants his girl and I love it

I can't leave 'em alone
I tried that good boy game, but the dope boy's turning me on
It's just that he know what I want

I can't leave 'em alone
I tried that game, but the dope boy's turning me on
It's just that he know what I want
So bad, I love that, I can't leave 'em alone

So when I had a good guy, he didn't do that much for me
Tried to be hard, but that he could never be
Always tell me that no one could compare to me
But couldn't handle it when other guy was staring at me
Now the top lays back so everyone could look at me
From the A to hills up in Beverly
He's so fly that he knows how to carry me
First class when they talk, we don't hear what they say

That he does it with the best, runs it in the west
Tatted on his chest (Uh-huh)
I like it (So what?), I like it
And they say (That he's gonna hurt me)

The more I get, the more my ambition; tell me there's more
I'll move an eighth for that girl; I'll move a half for that boy
Then I flip that (Double up) kick back (Cuddle up)
Your friends try to confuse but you know what
My intentions are good, I can't help it I'm hood
I wouldn't change if I could, you shouldn't tell me I should

And be happy you're my girl 'cause I'm happy I'm your man (I can't)

How you said there was nobody else

I still have the letter you wrote when you told me
That I was the only girl you'd ever want in your life
I guess my friends were right

Each day goes by and each night, I cry
Somebody saw you with her last night
You gave me your word, ""Don't worry 'bout her""
You might love her now, but you loved me first
Said you'd never hurt me, but here we are
Oh, you swore on every star
How could you be so reckless with my heart?

You check in and out

And she must be perfect, oh well

To sing along to my stereo (Gym Class Heroes, baby!)

If I was just another dusty record on the shelf
Would you blow me off and play me like everybody else?
If I asked you to scratch my back, could you manage that?
Like yikky-yeah check it, Travie, I can handle that
Furthermore, I apologize for any skipping tracks
It's just the last girl that played me left a couple cracks
I used to, used to, used to, used to, now I'm over that
'Cause holding grudges over love is ancient artifacts

If I could only find a note to make you understand
I’d sing it softly in your ear and grab you by the hand
Just keep me stuck inside your head like your favorite tune
And know my heart's a stereo that only plays for you (Uh-ha-ha)

If I was an old-school, fifty-pound boombox (Remember them?)
Would you hold me on your shoulder wherever you walk?
Would you turn my volume up in front of the cops? (Turn it up)
And crank it higher every time they told you to stop (Peace)
And all I ask is that you don't get mad at me
When you have to purchase mad D batteries
Appreciate every mixtape your friends make
You never know, we come and go like on the interstate (Never know)

I think I finally found a note to make you understand
If you could hit it, sing along and take me by the hand
Just keep me stuck inside your head, like your favorite tune
You know my heart's a stereo that only plays for you (Uh-ha-ha)

I only pray you never leave me behind (Never leave me)
Because good music can be so hard to find (So hard to find)
I'll take your hand and hold it closer to mine (Yeah)
Thought love was dead, but now you're changing my mind (Yeah, yeah, come on, ooh)

So I'll give it a shot, give it all that I got

La de da de da
La de da de de
Suddenly you call my name
And I lose my brain
And I float up to the moon
La de da de de
La de da de da
When you laugh it makes me smile
And I love your style
So I wrote a song to this tune

Thank you stars for giving to me
The greatest gift that's still yet to be
I don't mind if fate's playing games
I'm happy your the same
It's so hard to say it
But darling let's face it
These feelings revealing
Cannot be ignored
So I'll work on this letter
'Til our timing gets better
Sincerely, yours truly
And forevermore",3

There was a cat that really was gone
Ra-Ra-Rasputin, Russia's greatest love machine
It was a shame how he carried on

He ruled the Russian land and never mind the Tsar
But the kazachok, he danced really wunderbar
In all affairs of state, he was the man to please
But he was real great when he had a girl to squeeze
For the Queen, he was no wheeler dealer
Though she'd heard the things he'd done
She believed he was a holy healer
Who would heal her son

There was a cat that really was gone

""This man's just gotta go"", declared his enemies
But the ladies begged, ""Don't you try to do it, please""
No doubt this Rasputin had lots of hidden charms
Though he was a brute, they just fell into his arms
Then one night, some men of higher standing
Set a trap, they're not to blame
""Come to visit us"", they kept demanding
And he really came

Ra-Ra-Rasputin, lover of the Russian Queen
They put some poison into his wine
Ra-Ra-Rasputin, Russia's greatest love machine
He drank it all and he said, ""I feel fine""
Ra-Ra-Rasputin, lover of the Russian Queen
They didn't quit, they wanted his head

Sneaking past the cameras, i shouldn’t have been in your fathers house
Christmas at your Nona house
Helping her set up that lil elf on the tree
Conversations wit your family about what you gone be
You always end up mad cuz they steady giving warnings
And that ain't what you wanted
You want someone supportive of what you wanted to be
Well girl you always got me
And right here imma stand
Ten toes imma be

Watching you strut down the runway
They say the devil wear Prada you trynna walk for them someday
Rain you love when its thunder
But catch a glow when its sunny
Almost three years past 20
Im starting to feel a lil funny
I always hungered for money
But now my stomach is grumbling
My heart is searching for something
Along the lines of the lover
Around you i start to stutter

İstediği şey, bebeğim, arkama öpücükler kondurman
Tüm gün boyunca birkaç yüz milyon öpücük yani
Bana zevk veren tek şey bu
Sana yaramaz şeyler yapmak istediğimi biliyorsun

This liquid courage got me way too honest
Put your phone on vibrate, let's catch a vibe, babe
While the sun's down
Hush now, I know we're a little too fucked up to stay still, love
Be as quiet as you can, 'cause if anyone sees
They'll just blow shit up
I don't gotta know if you're taken
I'll just let ya know bedroom's vacant
No one's gotta know, just us and the moon 'til the sun starts wakin'

Up's the only direction I see
As long as we keep this

Low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low-key (Ah-ah, ah-ah)
You ain't even gotta lo- lo- lo- lo- lo- lo- lo-love me (Ah-ah, ah-ah)
Us in a king-size, keep it a secret
Say I'm your queen, I don't wanna leave this
Low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low-key

Wizard with words tellin' me my energy's so bewitchin'
So I'll go first, there's an open bar, let's close this distance
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh my, don't make me have to spell it
All, all, all, all, all night
I don't really give a fuck 'bout all the 'he said, she said' bullshit
So pick your poison, love, let's go somewhere a little more exclusive
Take a shot, take a chance, take my hand, boy
Tension so intense like an asteroid
Be discreet, gotta dodge all the tabloids

Let's not think too much, there ain't no problems
So long as we keep this

Low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low-key (Ah-ah, ah-ah)
You ain't even gotta lo- lo- lo- lo- lo- lo- lo-love me (Ah-ah, ah-ah)

Little dress a little tight
Feelin' everybody's eyes on my body
I'm not one to tell a lie
Something 'bout it gets me high
Maybe that isn't right but I want it

Sweatin' out on the floor
Staying out 'til the mornin'
It makes me want more
Can't fight it, can't fight it
I just can't get enough
Wish that I could ignore it
This almost feels like love

I'm the king of being bad
I should get myself some habits
That are better for me
But being good is boring
Do it while I can
Sorry, mom, it makes you mad
I'm not better for it
But being good is boring

Anothеr day waking up
Promise I'm gonna stop
For a couple hours I can act like an angеl
But it only takes a call
Suddenly I'm falling
Fucking up and dancing on tables

Sweatin' out on the floor
Staying out 'til the mornin'
It makes me want more
Can't fight it, can't fight it
I just can't get enough

Leave this party, hit the streets, back to my bed
Let's go mess up all the sheets
Get my lipstick on your teeth
Love your body under me

Nothing remains left behind
Forever be clawing forward
Continuance of my line

Writhing with virility
Instinct to perpetuate
Divert mortality
Extend my soul beyond


Anticipation of a reward so pleasing
Inhibitions ensnaring me like shackles
Unrelenting urge to quench, to gratify
All consuming senses of the primitive

And I remain drenched
In the excess of every movement
Serenity of this repetition

Forever be searching forward
Nothing remains left behind
Forever clawing forward
Continuance of my life

Forever be searching forward",2

I pity the poor fool, her
Fruitless in a holster and clueless in a kiss

You wring out your melon

Telling me repeatedly all the things you want to be

Wishing like Pinocchio

That soon no longer could my true heart hold you
And like the angular Etruscan tchotchke my mom got me
At the Met gift shop in '92
Tearing from the brown paper bag I kept it in when it was new
After I left it overnight when it was wet with dew
It sounds blue and shitty
But of course kid, like the little skinny bronze horse did
You fell through
You were like a buoy I put down in open ocean
But with no cross staff and no compass in my possession
And too far out for a lighthouse to provide discretion
How could I presume that you'd divine direction
Must have patience
Accept no imitations
Take no paper hearts and fucking hate carnations
Though my home is vacant
Yeah I'm lonesome while I wait
That's no open invitation made to hope we make acquaintance
The long walks home from the laundromat
In Pop-Pop's Holden Caulfield hat
Alone, lost for certain
Dry and pent
Dead bent like a merchant ivory gent
Yes, to yet get a spouse and kids
Have a house full
