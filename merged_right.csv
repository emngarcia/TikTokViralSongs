Yeah, come on
Shake, shake

I'll take you home if you don't leave me at the front door
Your body's cold, but girl, we're getting so warm
And I was thinking of ways that I could get inside

Tonight, you're falling in love (Let me go now)
This feeling's tearing me up (Here we go now)

Now if she does it like this, will you do it like that?
Now if she touches like this, will you touch her right back?
Now if she moves like this, will you move her like that?
Come on, shake shake, shake shake, a-shake it

A-shake shake, shake shake, a-shake it

Your lips tremble, but your eyes are in a straight stare
We're on the bed, but your clothes are laying right there
And I was thinking of places that I could hide

Tonight you're falling in love (Let me go now)
This feeling's tearing me up (Here we go now)

Now if she does it like this, will you do it like that?
Now if she touches like this, will you touch her right back?
Now if she moves like this, will you move her like that?

A-shake shake, shake shake, a-shake it

I saw you dancing and I couldn't get you off my mind
And I could tell that you could tell that I was taking my time
But I was thinking of ways to get you staying the night
Your body's shaking, tell me off so I can turn off the lights

Now if she does it like this, will you do it like that?
Now if she touches like this, will you touch her right back?
Now if she moves like this, will you move her like that?

Keep hopin' for, that the court is yours
Keep calls on hold, 'cause I don't wanna live in a broken home

Everyone seemed to say it was so great
But did I miss out? Was it a huge mistake?

I can't help the fact I like to be alone
It might sound kinda sad, but that's just what I seem to know
I tend to handle things usually by myself
And I can't ever seem to try and ask for help

I'm sitting here, crying in my prom dress
I'd be the prom queen if crying was a contest
Make-up is running down, feelings are all around
How did I get here? I need to know
I guess I maybe had a couple expectations
Thought I'd get to them, but no, I didn't
I guess I thought that prom was gonna be fun
But now I'm sitting on the floor and all I wanna do is run

I keep collections of masks upon my wall
To try and stop myself from revealing it all
Affecting others is the last thing I would do
I keep to myself though I want to break through

I hold so many small regrets
And what-ifs down inside my head
Some confidence, it couldn't hurt me
My demeanor is often misread

And then I'm in love and I been frontin' that it's just for the summer
And I been ditchin' other bitches 'cause you all that I wanted
And I'll be here for you, lil' baby, let's turn nothin' to somethin', you know, huh
Bumpin' Mac DeMarco, you perfect, you know? Huh
I just wanna love you, I'm learnin', you know, hey
I been on the road and it's showin'
But I'm still goin' to keep holdin' onto somethin', I know you know
You got that one-two dance when I got you in my hand
And I hope you know I love you, and I'm comin' for your mans
And I know you know it's hard that I been leaving you again
But we'll always be together, you my Darling in the Franxx
Ayy, I said like, I don't say a lot, but there's a lot to say
And I don't play a lot, so why you got to play?
And you could be my summer, be my brightest day
And know I promise I'll come back, you know I'll find a way

Okay, like criss-cross applesauce, lil' baby, caress me
I been doin' all this shit, just hopin' that you impress me
When I level up, girl, I'll buy you diamonds and jetskis
And your girlfriend, that might be the one that I'm texting
You my angel, girl, I think you come from above
My diamonds glisten, shinin' in the tunnel of love
And now we kissin', girl, I think your tongue is so fun
Play Mac DeMarco, now we chillin' under the sun"

Though we’re only sixteen
And sit down beside me

Promise that you'll stay here
You and I can lay here
Until the end of time

But girl, well don't you worry about me
It ain’t new to me, feeling this lonely (Darling)
Girl, don't worry about me
But if you’re ever unhappy
Then maybe, baby, I must let you go
Let you go

Baby, now it’s best here, to lay me down and rest here
Let’s dream of Corduroy
Work for what you love to do and I will watch right over you
With your heart, I’ll never toy
And you’re the other half of me
Drink and sleep and laugh with me
Save me from myself
See I’m a fucking basket-case
Until I'm able to see your face

And ever since I was a child, I'd make the boys go wild

All you wanna do

Take my first music teacher, Henry Mannox
I was young, it's true
But even then, I knew
(sung)
The only thing you wanna do is... mwah
Broad, dark, sexy Mannox
Taught me all about dynamics
He was twenty-three
And I was thirteen, going on thirty
We spent hours strumming the lute
Striking the chords and blowing the flute
He plucked my strings all the way to G
Went from major to minor, C to D
Tell me what you need
What you want, you don't need to plead
'Cause I feel the chemistry
Like I get you and you get me
And maybe this is it
He just cares so much, it feels legit
We have a connection
I think this guy is different
'Cause, all you wanna do
All you wanna do, baby
Is touch me, love me, can't get enough, see
All you wanna do
All you wanna do, baby
Is please me, squeeze me, birds and the bees me
Run your fingers through my hair
Tell me I'm the fairest of the fair
Playtime's over
The only thing you wanna do is... mwah
(spoken)
But then there was another guy, Francis Dereham
(sung)
Serious, stern and slow
Gets what he wants and he won't take no
Passion in all that he touches
The sexy secretary to the dowager duchess
Helped him in his office, had a duty to fulfill
He even let me use his favorite quill
Spilled ink all over the parchment
My wrist was so tired
Still, I came back the next day as he required
You say, I'm all you need
All you want, you don't need to plead
'Cause I feel the chemistry
Like I get you and you get me
And I know this is it
He just cares so much, this one's legit
We have a real connection
I'm sure this time is different
'Cause, all you wanna do
All you wanna do, baby
Is touch me, love me, can't get enough, see
All you wanna do
All you wanna do, baby
Is please me, squeeze me, birds and the bees me
You can't wait a second more
To get my corset on the floor
Playtime's over
The only thing you wanna do is... mwah
(spoken)
Yeah, that didn't work out
So I decided to have a break from boys
And you'll never guess who I met!
(sung)
Tall, large, Henry VIII
Supreme head of the Church of England
Globally revered
Although you wouldn't know it from the look of that beard
Made me a lady-in-waiting, held
Me and my family up in the world
Gave me duties in court and he swears it's true
That, without me, he doesn't know what he'd do
You say, I'm all you need
All you want, we both agree
This is the place for me
I'm finally where I'm meant to be
Then he starts saying all this stuff
He cares so much, he calls me ""Love""
He says we have this connection
I guess it's not so different
'Cause, all you wanna do
All you wanna do, baby
Is touch me, love me, can't get enough, see
All you wanna do
All you wanna do, baby
Is seize me, squeeze me, birds and the bees me
There's no time for when or how
'Cause you've just got to have me now
Playtime's over
The only thing you wanna do is... mwah
(spoken)
So we got married. .. . . woo!
(sung)
With Henry, it isn't easy
His temper's short and his mates are sleazy
Except for this one courtier
He's a really nice guy, just so sincere
The royal life isn't what I planned
But Thomas is there to lend a helping hand
So sweet, makes sure that I'm okay
And we hang out loads when the King's away
This guy, finally
Is what I want, the friend I need
Just mates, no chemistry
I get him and he gets me
And there's nothing more to it
He just cares so much, he's devoted
He says we have a connection
I thought this time was different
Why did I think he'd be different?
But it's never, ever different
'Cause, all you wanna do
All you wanna do, baby
Is touch me, when will enough be enough, see?
All you wanna do
All you wanna do, baby
Is squeeze me, don't care if you don't please me
Bite my lip and pull my hair
As you tell me I'm the fairest of the fair

Playtime's over
Playtime's over

Playtime's over
The only thing, the only thing...

The only thing you wanna do is... mwah…ha.."

Swore I thought I'd never fall again, don't think I'm just talkin'
I think I might go all in, no exceptions, girl, I need ya

Feeling like I'm out of my mind, 'cause I can't get enough
Only one that I give my time, 'cause I got eyes for ya
Might make an exception for ya, 'cause I been feelin' ya
Think I might be out of my mind, I think that you're the one

My last made me feel like I would never try again
But when I saw you, I felt something I never felt
Come closer, I'll give you all my love
If you treat me right, baby, I'll give you everything
My last made me feel like I would never try again
But when I saw you, I felt something I never felt
Come closer, I'll give you all my love

Will never give my all again
'Cause I'm sick of falling down
When I open up and give my trust
They find a way to break it down
Break down
Tear me up inside
When you break me down"

What I tell them hoes? Bow, bow, bow to me, drop down to your knees
Young Money the mafia, that's word to Lil' Cease

Doing target practice, all these bitches just aiming to please
Shout out to the CEO, 500 Degreez
Shout out to the OVO, red wings and fatigues, oh
Niggas wanna be friends, how coincidental
This supposed to be y'all year? We ain't get the memo
A young king, pay me in gold

These niggas be droppin' songs, they ain't even cold
Weezy on top, and that nigga ain't even home yet
Yeah, be very afraid
These other rappers gettin' bodied and carried away
Fuck it, me and Nicki Nick gettin' married today
And all you bitches that be hatin' can catch a bouquet, ooh
Yeah, you a star in my eyes
You and all them white girls, party of five
Are we drinking a lil' more? I can hardly decide
I can't believe we really made it, I'm partly surprised, I swear
Damn, this one for the books, man
I swear this shit is as fun as it looks, man
I'm really tryna make it more than what it is

Life, I can tell it's time
Drifting away, I'm

If she ask to spend the night then I might give her what she want
(Dystinkt Beats)

Everything is going Gucci, see me Lou V
I can't let a nigga shoot me, I'm in a two seat
And before I speak about it, rather grab a loose leaf
Thirty clip of the dip, and I'm in a hoopty
And we spin the opp block with a mini Uzi
Had to send a couple shots, I been acting bougie
All the sudden all these thots let me in they coochie
They gon' make they pussy pop tryna get my blue cheese
Low-key I be in the streets tryna OD
Low-key 'cause the industry, I'm not the old me
Low-key started peeping niggas not my homies
Phony nigga ate that shit like macaroni
And I remember last year niggas went to Coney
Never thought that this year I'd have a deal with Sony
Lil TJay SB, I'm the one and only
And I just came home and everybody know me
If you want another GOAT, guess you gotta clone me
Quit talkin' 'bout some loyalty you never showed me
Nigga, I don't owe you like you never owed me
Once I got a little clout, everybody know me
And we never had to prove this, we really do this
You was never in the field, you was on your school shit
Now my energy is boosted, my mind exuded
They gon' make a nigga lose it, they acting stupid
I got up out my Birkin, it's workin'
She said she a virgin, it's hurtin'
But she ain't never show me love when my pockets hurtin'
Now she see a nigga on, she fucking and slurping
And they see me puttin' on and it got them nervous
We don't never need to ball, I did it on purpose
And I used to play the block with the fiends, got some knots in my jeans
If a nigga talk hot, we gon' pop for his bean (Nah-nah)
I'm coming strong and they knew that
You ain't no competition, boy, don't think you wanna do that (I'm like)
You had your chance, but you blew that (Lil Tjay)
Everybody asking who that? (Oh, no, no, no, no)
The fuck going on?
Someone in my circle started leaking all my songs
I'ma stay ten toes, I'ma still go strong
I don't get these snake niggas, we just can't get along

So I'm skrrting off the scene in a foreign, see me goin'
Me and YG up in Cali smoking JT out the bong
Shawty pulled up in a thong, I don't know what she on
If she ask to spend the night then I might give her what she want
Fuck her one time, maybe two times if she too fine
Make your boo mine, I'm in the stu', this my new grind
I'm cooking up, I'm cooking up, ain't tryna lose time
I shoot it up, don't give a fuck, ain't tryna lose mine

Gangbang, growing up I was Stain Gang
Stain Gang, promise I was only tryna maintain
Lil TJay SB, that's the gang gang
Ask about me, bet they tell you how my name ring
And I know they gon' hate 'cause I'm up now
I'm at the point where I don't really give a fuck now
Free the guys, I'ma say it 'til they touch down
One day everybody have a bustdown

So I'm skrrting off the scene in a foreign, see me goin'

Like when you said you felt so happy, you could die
I told myself that you were right for me
But felt so lonely in your company
But that was love and it's an ache I still remember


You can get addicted to a certain kind of sadness
Like resignation to the end, always the end
So when we found that we could not make sense
Well, you said that we would still be friends
But I'll admit that I was glad it was over

But you didn't have to cut me off
Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing
And I don't even need your love
But you treat me like a stranger and that feels so rough
No, you didn't have to stoop so low
Have your friends collect your records and then change your number
I guess that I don't need that, though
Now you're just somebody that I used to know
Now you're just somebody that I used to know
Now you're just somebody that I used to know


Now and then, I think of all the times you screwed me over
But had me believing it was always something that I'd done
But I don't wanna live that way
Reading into every word you say
You said that you could let it go
And I wouldn't catch you hung up on somebody that you used to know

But you didn't have to cut me off
Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing (Ah)
And I don't even need your love (Ooh)

You are deformed I am deformed
And you are ugly And I am ugly
And these are crimes for which
The world shows little pity
You do not comprehend You're my defender

As a monster I am monster
Out there, they will hate
And scorn and jeer Only monster
Why invite their curses and their consternation?
Stay in here
Be faithful to me I'm faithful
Grateful to me I'm grateful
Do as I say
Obey
And stay in here I'll stay in here

Remember, Quasimodo.  This is your sanctuary
""Out There""

...My sanctuary...
Safe behind these windows and these parapets of stone
Gazing at the people down below me
All my life I watch them as I hide up here alone
Hungry for the histories they show me
All my life I memorize their faces
Knowing them as they will never know me
All my life I wonder how it feels to pass a day
Not above them
But part of them
And out there, living in the sun
Give me one day out there, all I ask is one
To hold forever, out there
Where they all live unaware
What I'd give, what I'd dare
Just to live one day out there!
Out there among the millers and the weavers and their wives
Through the roofs and gables I can see them
Every day they shout and scold and go about their lives
Heedless of the gift it is to be them
If I were in their skin, I'd treasure every instant
Out there, strolling by the Seine
Taste a morning out there, like ordinary men
Who freely walk about there
Just one day and then I swear I'll be content
With my share
Won't resent
Won't despair
Old and bent
I won't care
I'll have spent one day out there!"

And then I lose the strength to leave

I can't handle change
I can't handle change

Nothing I do is ever good
Nothing I do is ever good enough
Nothing I do is ever good
Nothing I do is ever good
Nothing I do is ever good enough
Nothing I do is ever good

Leave me alone
Leave me alone
(I wanna go home now)
Leave me alone
Leave me alone
(I wanna go home now)

I can't help but repeat myself
""I know it's not your fault""
Still lately I begin to shake
For no reason at all
For no reason at all
For no reason at all
For no reason at all
For no reason at all"

Kept thinkin' I could never live without you by my side
But then I spent so many nights thinkin' how you did me wrong
And I grew strong, and I learned how to get along

And so you're back, from outer space
I just walked in to find you here with that sad look upon your face
I should have changed that stupid lock
I should have made you leave your key
If I'd have known for just one second you'd be back to bother me

Go on now, go, walk out the door
Just turn around now, 'cause you're not welcome anymore
Weren't you the one who tried to hurt me with goodbye?
Did you think I'd crumble? Did you think I'd lay down and die?

Oh no, not I, I will survive
Oh, as long as I know how to love, I know I'm still alive
I've got all my life to live, and I've got all my love to give
And I'll survive, I will survive, hey hey


It took all the strength I had, not to fall apart
Just tryin' hard to mend the pieces of my broken heart
And I spent oh so many nights just feeling sorry for myself
I used to cry, but now I hold my head up high
And you see me, somebody new
I'm not that chained up little person still in love with you
And so you felt like droppin' in and just expect me to be free
Well, now I'm saving all my lovin' for someone who's lovin' me

Go on now, go, walk out the door
Just turn around now, 'cause you're not welcome anymore
Weren't you the one who tried to break me with goodbye?
Did you think I'd crumble? Did you think I'd lay down and die?

Oh no, not I, I will survive
Oh, as long as I know how to love, I know I'm still alive
I've got all my life to live, and I've got all my love to give
And I'll survive, I will survive, oh

Go on now go, walk out the door
Just turn around now, 'cause you're not welcome anymore
Weren't you the one who tried to break me with goodbye?
Did you think I'd crumble? Did you think I'd lay down and die?

Oh, as long as I know how to love, I know I'm still alive

That's fine, 'cause nothing's gonna scare us now
We're all in our dressing gowns, mine's white and stripey
Yours is green and brown

I forgot my name again
I think that's something worth remembering
Spiders in your favourite shoes
Just leave them be 'cause they're more scared of you

How to let you go and let communication die out

Down for forever and it's fine
I know, you know, we know we weren't
Meant for each other and it's fine

But if the world was ending, you'd come over, right?
You'd come over and you'd stay the night
Would you love me for the hell of it?

And there wouldn't be a reason why
We would even have to say goodbye

Stumbled in the house and didn't make it past the kitchen

Believe that
How are you doing?
Alright
So, Eazy, tell me, how was your life as a youngster?

Ruthless, my style as a juvenile
Ran with a gang, slanged in the meanwhile
Bankin', I specialized in gankin'
Whites, Mexicans, brothers and others
Daily, it's all about comin' up
Makin' sure no punks are runnin' up
Because I'm a gangsta havin' fun​
Strapped with a gat when I'm walkin' through Compton
Terrible, I never listened to my mother
It went in one ear and out the other
Ran my gang, sold undercover
Call a girl out her name, yo, I ain't no lover
I'm a pimp, mack daddy, lookin' for the dollar
At thirteen I bought a '6-4 Impala
Rollin' and runnin' from the police
Brother, don't you know you can't trust a thief
Or thug, convict, hoodlum or criminal?
Leave your car open, gank for your stereo
Hard and raw, no regard for the law
Eazy-E, were you ever caught slipping? Hell nah
Just trippin' off 8-ball
And girls ain't nothin' but female dogs to me
Bitches, I'm sorry for that verse
It's in my nature, I gotta curse
Out anybody gettin' on my nerves
You get beat, ganked, broke and served
So you know who I am
And if you don't like it, I really don't give a damn

Hmm, I see, so you're rather violent?
Sometimes
Okay, what would be the situation when you so-call ""gank"" someone?
Waitin' for some people to leave
I got another trick up my sleeve
Step with pep to the back of the house
Looked in, all the lights are out
Grabbed the door and it's locked, so
Easily made my way to the window
Lift it up slow 'cause it takes timing
Looked around and then I climbed in
Once inside, I start takin'
'Cause you know, it's no time for shakin'
Get what you gonna get, front and center
Or get five years for breakin' and enter
Move quickly, but no runnin'
Shh, I think somebody's comin'
Hear the front door key and I flee
Out the back with a fist full of jewelry
Over the wall, don't fall
Wipe my sweat 'cause that was a close call
Gettin' ganked by the E is a lesson
So is there any more questions?

Yes, as a matter of fact, there is
Have you ever been involved in, like, an armed robbery or a hold-up?
You mean a two-eleven?
Yeah

There's a store, but don't point
Walk inside, case the joint
One man behind the counter, another in the back
Go out to the car and load the gat
Grabbed the ski mask, here's the task
Go in broke, come out with cash
Were you slick? Yeah, you gotta be cunnin'
Told Ice Cube to leave the car runnin'
Walked in, said, ""This is a robbery""
Didn't need the money, it's just a hobby
Fill the bag, homeboy, don't lag
I want money, beer, and a pack of Zig-Zags
The man in the back had a camera
So he came out to test his stamina
Against Eazy-E, but he took one
Fell to the floor, so I run
Back to the bucket, then I said, ""Punch it""
Took the gun and then dumped it
I'm not like Robin Hood, 'cause I want more
Steal from the rich, hang with the poor
My pockets are fat, you see, it don't matter to me
I feel like nobody is badder than me
Is all that true? I don't lie
You see, I'm not Mr. Nice Guy

Oh, so you're not exactly a role model?
Not exactly
And for your listeners, what does Eazy-E think of himself?

Bad and bold, you can't get with this
Those that tried, you're on my shit list
Can't be caught, sought or fought
Taught, and damn sure bought
Down and dirty from the CPT
N.W.A and Eazy-E
One more, before we end this session
What's your real age? No more questions"

Can’t make me stop
I wanna go hunting, any takers?
I’m not fake ‘cause I’ve got acres and acres
Paid for with my own riches
Where my hounds at? Release the bitches

Pull up outside in my carriage, don’t got no marriage
So I have a little flirt with the footman
As he takes my fur

Making my way to the dance floor
Some boys make an advance, I ignore them
‘Cause my jam comes on the lute, lookin' cute

Dance so hard that I’m causin’ a sensation

West of Santa Fé
We were seventeen, but he was sweet and it was true
Still I did what I had to do
'Cause I just knew
Summer; Sunday nights
We'd sink into our seats
Right as they dimmed out all the lights
A Technicolor world made out of music and machine
It called me to be on that screen
And live inside each scene

Without a nickel to my name
Hopped a bus, here I came
Could be brave or just insane

We'll have to see

'Cause maybe in that sleepy town
He'll sit one day, the lights are down
He'll see my face and think of how he...

...used to know me

Climb these hills
I'm reaching for the heights
And chasing all the lights that shine
And when they let you down
You'll get up off the ground
'Cause morning rolls around
And it's another day of sun

I hear 'em ev'ry day
The rhythms in the canyons
That'll never fade away
The ballads in the barrooms
Left by those who came before
They say ""you gotta want it more""
So I bang on ev'ry door

And even when the answer's ""no""
Or when my money's running low
The dusty mic and neon glow
Are all I need

And someday as I sing my song
A small-town kid'll come along

That'll be the thing to push him on and go go

Climb these hills
I'm reaching for the heights
And chasing all the lights that shine

You'll get up off the ground

Rude Boy and Chucky down with the clown
First time we ever went to Mexicantown
I remember, we couldn't pay the bill, they got hot
And beat us down in the fuckin' parking lot (Fuck you!)
Tall Jess, Jumpsteady, and Nate the Mack
Tagged ICP by the train tracks
And it was on, the dawn of a new day
Magical carpets grippin' down the freeway (Whoop, whoop)
Walked in a gypsy's tent with a food stamp
And walked out with a magical lamp, yeah
I met Milenko, he gave me three wishes
That night, I fucked three fat bitches
Can't get the fuck with it? Forget it
I'll rip your face off and wipe my ass with it
When the genie says on with the show
It's hokus pokus, jokers, Great Milenko

Without a trace of mockery

Everyone's high as a kite
Ain't nobody home tonight

Stoned, zoned, I should quit
Hey, is that weed? I want a hit

Fill that joint and roll it tight
Ain't nobody home tonight

Dreams are comin' true
When people laugh, but not at you
I'm not alone, I'm not afraid
I feel like Bono at LiveAid

Hi, Ram
I— I wasn't gonna come, but since you took the time to write that sweet note

What note?
Why do you gotta be so weird all the time?
People wouldn't hate you so much if you acted normal

But I love wrappin' them bodies and shit
Fuck the bitch, and when I get done

Shoot him in the face, get his teeth lit
Extended clip like a broomstick
Shoot a flick like Netflix
Scratch an opp off the checklist
I just bought a gun off Craigslist
Shoot an opp in the brain, I'm leavin' a stain, only thing you see is red shit
If the police behind, we keep duckin'
My gun need some drawers, it got nuts

I pray that you don't get it all at once

All in the comments, you wanna vomit
That's your baby, you love her to death
Now she cuttin' class and hangin' with friends
You break a glass and say it again
She can't comprehend the danger she in
If you whoop her ass, she move in with him
Then he whoop her ass, you go through it again
But how you the devil rebukin' the sin?
Let's pray we can put this behind us
I swear that these times is the wildest
She got the scars, they serve as reminders
Blood still on her pajamas
But yesterday is dead, yeah, moment of silence
Next, she'll be off to college and then at the altar
'Cause she know that niggas is savage, niggas is monsters

Nie rozumieją rozmowy o torbie, jestem obcokrajowcem
Kiedy myślą, że przewyższają królową, zaczynają spadać
Słowo do moich strzałów w dupę, jestem taki bezczelny
Got 'em tryna palm mój tyłek jak młody Keke
Tak, jestem w getcie, słowo do Geppetto
Poza tym jestem mały, gdzie jest mój szpilek?
Powiedz Mike'owi Jordanowi, wyślij mi moje Retros
Kiedyś byłem bi, ale teraz jestem po prostu hetero
Nie mówię o medycynie, ale uczyniłem go bardziej deanem
Odkąd umieściłem ciasteczko na kwarantannie

Nigdy nie widział tego w takiej sukience (Ah)
On nawet nie był pod takim wrażeniem
Prolly, dlaczego uciszyłem go na planie jak zamek błyskawiczny
Lubię to, kocham to, potrzebuję tego, źle
Weź to, posiadaj to, kradnij to, szybko
Chłopcze, przestań się bawić, chwyć mnie za tyłek
Dlaczego zachowujesz się jak nieśmiały? (Gorący)
Zamknij to, zachowaj to, nie przestawaj naciskać
Dlaczego owijasz w bawełnę?
Wiedzę, że chcesz tej całej kobiety
Nigdy nie pukaj, dopóki nie spróbujesz (Yah, yah)
Wszystkie te suki nienawidzą, że mam cię ze sobą
Wszystkie moje czarnuchy mówią, że jesteś szalony
Prawdziwiejszy niż ktokolwiek, kogo miałeś, i ładny
Całe ciało-ody, tyłek i cycki

Ludzie z najmniejszym zawsze robią najwięcej
Liczę pieniądze, podczas gdy on ssie moje palce u stóp
Naprawdę paskudny z ich jajami, cała sieć, tak, jestem obrzydliwy
Dlaczego mówisz o tym, kto fałszywy?

Porque nós poderíamos ficar em casa ou assistir ao pôr do sol
Mas eu não posso deixar de perguntar, ""você já está entediada?""
E se você está se sentindo sozinha, você deveria me dizer
Antes que isso termine como mais uma memória
Você vai dizer a verdade, para que eu não tenha que mentir?
Você vai dizer a verdade, para que eu não tenha que mentir?

Parece que te conheço a minha vida inteira
Eu consigo ver através das suas mentiras
Eu não sei para onde estamos indo
Mas gostaria de estar ao seu lado
Se você puder me dizer como você está se sentindo
Talvez nós consigamos passar por isso sem sermos derrotados
Aguentando por tanto tempo

Porque nós poderíamos ficar em casa ou assistir ao pôr do sol

Ridin' around town in a big ol' Range
I knew her when I rocked big ol' jeans
Now the little nigga doin' big ol' thangs
Would you look at that? I came back for her
Just to give it to ya, like you asked for it
Man, that thing in them jeans too fat for her
Rebounds so I caught her off the backboard
I told her: “Baby girl, come here
Know I run the town even when I ain't from there.”
And I brag hardly, but just to show up at this party
I made what yo' nigga make in one year
That's unfair, but so is life, take a chance, roll the dice
Money can’t buy you love, 'cause it’s overpriced
Don’t overthink, just hope it's right

They be startin' shit, but it’s yo' world
On my Martin shit: “You go, girl!”

Some niggas save hoes, I’m not that heroic
Could you be my escort?
'Cause just like them two door Fords
Damn, they don’t make 'em like you no more

Them boys cool—me, I’m on fire
Know what's on my mind
Tryna see what's on yours tonight, tonight, tonight
Move slow, 'cause you wanna live fast

Life is a test so before the night pass, get right, get right

And he's perfect on paper, but he's lying to my face
Does he think that I'm the kinda girl who needs to be saved?

And there's one more boy, he's from my past
We fell in love, but it didn't last
'Cause the second I figure it out, he pushes me away
And I won't fight for love if you won't meet me halfway
And I say that I'm through, but this song's still for you

All I want is love that lasts
Is all I want too much to ask?
Is it something wrong with me?
All I want is a good guy
Are my expectations far too high?
Try my best, but what can I say?
All I have is myself at the end of the day
But shouldn't that be enough for me?

Now every woman I see is a potential threat
And I'm possessive, it isn't nice
You've heard me saying that smoking was my only vice

But now it isn't true
Now everything is new
And all I've learned has overturned
I beg of you

Don't go wasting your emotion
Lay all your love on me

It was like shooting a sitting duck
A little small talk, a smile, and baby, I was stuck
I still don't know what you've done with me
A grown-up woman should never fall so easily

I feel a kind of fear
When I don't have you near
Unsatisfied, I skip my pride
I beg you, dear

Don't go wasting your emotion
Lay all your love on me
Don't go sharing your devotion
Lay all your love on me

I've had a few little love affairs
They didn't last very long and they've been pretty scarce
I used to think that was sensible
It makes the truth even more incomprehensible

'Cause everything is new
And everything is you
And all I've learned has overturned
What can I do?

Don't go wasting your emotion
Lay all your love on me

What is this?

We have the check stubs from separate accounts

Almost a thousand dollars, paid in different amounts

To a Mr. James Reynolds way back in 1791

Is that what you have? Are you done?
You are uniquely situated by virtue of your position

Though virtue is not a word I'd apply to this situation

To seek financial gain, to stray from your sacred mission

And the evidence suggests you've engaged in speculation

An immigrant embezzling our government funds

I can almost see the headline, your career is done

I hope you saved some money for your daughter and sons

Ya best g'wan run back where ya come from

Ha! You don't even know what you’re asking me to confess

Confess

You have nothing, I don't have to tell you anything at all
Unless

Unless

If I can prove that I never broke the law
Do you promise not to tell another soul what you saw?

No one else was in the room where it happened

Is that a yes?

Um, yes
""Dear Sir, I hope this letter finds you in good health
And in a prosperous enough position to put wealth
In the pockets of people like me, down on their luck
You see, that was my wife who you decided to""

What?!
She courted me
Escorted me to bed and when she had me in a corner
That's when Reynolds extorted me
For a sordid fee, I paid him quarterly
I may have mortally wounded my prospects
But my papers are orderly
As you can see, I kept a record of every check in my checkered history
Check it again against your list and see consistency
I never spent a cent that wasn't mine
You sent the dogs after my scent, that's fine
Yes, I have reasons for shame
But I have not committed treason and sullied my good name
As you can see, I have done nothing to provoke legal action
Are my answers to your satisfaction?

My God

Gentlemen, let's go

So?

The people won't know what we know

I feed and water an idea so I let it grow
I tell them, ""Take it easy"", they laugh and tell me no
It's cool but I don't see them laughing at my money though
They spitting facts at me, I'm spitting tracks, catch me?
I'm spinning gold out my records, know you can't combat me
They tell me, ""Jesus walks"", I tell them, ""Money talks""

I'll give them stories to tell friends about the things I said
They tell me I'm so humble, I say, ""I'm turning red""
They let me lie to them and don't feel like they've been misled
They give so much to me, I'm losing touch, get me?
Served on a silver platter, ask for seconds, they just let me

Six-feet off the ground at all times, I think I'm feeling odd
No matter what I make, they never see mistakes
Makin' so much bread, I don't care that they're just being fake
They tell me they're below me, I act like I'm above
The people blend together but I would be lost without their love

Can you heal me? Have I gained too much?

Is there a real me? Pop the champagne

I'm standing there
On a balcony in summer air
See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say, ""Hello""
Little did I know

That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet""
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you, ""Please don't go,"" and I said

Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say, ""Yes""

So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew
So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while, oh, oh

'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter
And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet""
But you were everything to me
I was begging you, ""Please don't go,"" and I said

Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say, ""Yes""
Romeo, save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel
This love is difficult, but it's real
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
It's a love story, baby, just say, ""Yes""

Oh, oh

But I got tired of waiting
Wondering if you were ever coming around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town

And I said, ""Romeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you, but you never come
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think""
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring, and said
""Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone
I love you and that's all I really know
I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress

And when she was lonely, I was therе to comfort her
And I knew that she lovеd me

But she began to drift away, I was all alone
Still, I waited for the day

Just don't understand where we went wrong
I gave you my heart
I gave you my soul
I gave you—

As a matter of fact, I was the one who said I loved you first
It was about eight years ago, don't act like you don't know
We were sittin' at home in your mama's livin' room
'Cause we couldn't be alone
See, your mama knew I was somethin' else, she knew how I felt
Back then, we were in school and that's your favorite excuse
Growin' up, I was a fool and I can't lie, I'm missin' you
Listen and don't trip
I think I need a bottle with a genie in it

Here's my wish list
First one, I would create a heart-changin' love
Second one, I'll take yours and fill it all up
Third one, but I don't need a lot of wishes
'Cause I'll be okay if I get one

If I had one wish, we would be best friends
Love would never end, it would just begin
If I had one wish, you would be my boo
Promise to love you, trust me, I'll trust you
If I had one wish, we would run away
Makin' love all day, have us a baby
If I had one wish, I'll make you my whole life
And you'll be my wife, make it right this time
If I had one wish

One wish, one wish, one wish
One wish, one wish, one wish
One wish, one wish, one wish
One wish, one wish, one wish

Now, tell me, is this the only way I can get you right back in?
If so, then searchin' I'll go, then I can have you for sho
Then you'll be lovin' me, holdin' me, kissin' me
So girl, don't tell me what I'm feelin' is make-believe
I swear, if I lose a second chance with you
I wouldn't know what to do
I'll probably check myself into some kind of clinic
I couldn't be alone because without you, I'm sick

When suddenly my dentist started rubbing on my belly (Oh)
Looked down at her cart, she had the biscuits with the jelly

Gravy got racks, and my baby got back
(Gang, gang, gang)
Serenade your bitch on the sax (Huh)
No slack in my mack, y'all better relax

And you know my pedigree
Ex-dealer use to move amphetamines
Girl I, spend money like it don't mean nothing
And besides, I got a thing for you

I see you windin' and grindin' up on the floor
I know you see me lookin' at you and you already know
I wanna love you (Love you), you already know
I wanna love you (Love you), you already know, girl

Mobbin' through the club and I'm low pressin'
I'm sittin' in the back in the smoker's section (Just smokin', just smokin')
Bird's eye, I got a clear view
You can't see me, but I can see you (Baby, I see you)
Hmm, it's cool, we jet, the mood is set
Your p— is wet, you're rubbin' your back and touchin' your neck (Yeah)
Your body is movin', you humpin' and jumpin' (Yeah)
Your t— is bouncin', you smilin' and grinnin' and lookin' at me

Girl, and while you're lookin' at me, I'm ready to hit the caddy
Right up on the patio, move the patty to the caddy
Baby, you got a phatty, the type I like to marry
Wantin' to just give you everything and that's kinda scary
'Cause I'm loving the way you shake your ass
Bouncin' got me tippin' my glass
Normally don't get caught up too fast
But I got a thing for you

Ciara
I'm focused, man (DarkChild)
You should know this, man

Just one dose of me will have you addicted
To know me is to love me; I handle my business
Any city any town - touch down; I do my thing
I'm a hustler, baby, I provide by any means
I'm a great conversationist, you should know what I'm about
When you look at me baby you should see a way out
Out the hood, out the drama, out the Bentley that's on
Out the headache an stress you done been through before

It's only been three months and I already got it bad
So hood that I keep on coming back
My girlfriend's telling me I don't know how to act
But I'm telling them, ""Baby, bye, fall back""
He's so good and he knows how to love me
But so hood and he's so heavy in the streets
He's my dude and you better get used to things
And I don't care what you say about me
They say

That he does it with the best, runs it in the west
Tatted on his chest (Uh-huh)
I like it (So what?), I like it
And they say (That he's gonna hurt me)
Just wait and see (But they don't know me)
'Cause I am what he wants his girl and I love it

I can't leave 'em alone
I tried that good boy game, but the dope boy's turning me on
It's just that he know what I want
So bad, I love that, I can't leave 'em alone
I can't leave 'em alone
I tried that game, but the dope boy's turning me on
It's just that he know what I want
So bad, I love that, I can't leave 'em alone

So when I had a good guy, he didn't do that much for me
Tried to be hard, but that he could never be
Always tell me that no one could compare to me
But couldn't handle it when other guy was staring at me
Now the top lays back so everyone could look at me
From the A to hills up in Beverly
He's so fly that he knows how to carry me
First class when they talk, we don't hear what they say

That he does it with the best, runs it in the west
Tatted on his chest (Uh-huh)
I like it (So what?), I like it
And they say (That he's gonna hurt me)
Just wait and see (But they don't know me)
'Cause I am what he wants his girl and I love it

I can't leave 'em alone
I tried that good boy game, but the dope boy's turning me on
It's just that he know what I want
So bad, I love that, I can't leave 'em alone
I can't leave 'em alone
I tried that game, but the dope boy's turning me on
It's just that he know what I want
So bad, I love that, I can't leave 'em alone

The more I get, the more my ambition; tell me there's more
I'll move an eighth for that girl; I'll move a half for that boy
Then I flip that (Double up) kick back (Cuddle up)
Your friends try to confuse but you know what
My intentions are good, I can't help it I'm hood
I wouldn't change if I could, you shouldn't tell me I should
Baby, you should take me as I am
And be happy you're my girl 'cause I'm happy I'm your man (I can't)

If he gets caught, it just takes one call, I'll come running
Boy, I promise I will be there for you
All my heart, it belongs to you
I can't lose you, boy, I just can't leave you alone

I can't leave 'em alone (I can't leave 'em alone)
I tried that good boy game, but the dope boy's turning me on (Ah)
It's just that he know what I want
So bad, I love that, I can't leave 'em alone (So bad, I can't)
I can't leave 'em alone (I can't keep)
I tried that game, but the dope boy's turning me on (Baby, need you)
It's just that he know what I want (Oh, oh)
So bad, I love that, I can't leave 'em alone (So bad)
I can't leave 'em alone (Smile for me, yeah)
I tried that good boy game, but the dope boy's turning me on (Let me see his thrill)
It's just that he know what I want (I know what I want)
So bad, I love that, I can't leave 'em alone (Turning me on)
I can't leave 'em alone (Ah)
I tried that game, but the dope boy's turning me on (No)
It's just that he know what I want (So bad)

It's another Darkchild classic, man
Leave you all alone
Leave you all alone

They go, ""Isn't she lovely, this Hollywood girl?""
And they say

""She's so lucky, she's a star""
But she cry, cry, cries in her lonely heart, thinking
""If there's nothing missing in my life
Then why do these tears come at night?""

Lost in an image, in a dream
But there's no one there to wake her up
And the world is spinning, and she keeps on winning
But tell me, what happens when it stops?

And I'm ballin', that's why it's diamonds on my jersey
Slide on opps' side and flip the block back, yeah, yeah
My junior popped him and left him lopsided, yeah, yeah
We spin his block, got the rebound, Dennis Rodman
Fool me one time, you can't cross me again
Twelve hundred horsepower, I get lost in the wind
If he talkin' on the yard, the pen' dogs'll take his chin
Maybach SUV for my refugees
Buy blocks in the hood, put money in the streets
I was solo when the opps caught me at the gas station
Had it on me, thirty thousand, thought it was my last day
But they ain't even want no smoke
If I had to choose it, murder what she wrote-oh-oh-oh

Let's go
Brand new Lamborghini, fuck a cop car
With the pistol on my hip like I'm a cop (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Have you ever met a real nigga rockstar?
This ain't no guitar, bitch, this a Glock (Glock, Glock, Glock, Glock)
My Glock told me to promise you gon' squeeze me (Woo)
You better let me go the day you need me (Woo)
Soon as you up me on that nigga, get to bustin' (Woo)
And if I ain't enough, go get the chop (chop, chop, chop, chop)

Woo, woo
Go get the chop (Chop, chop, chop, chop)
Woo, woo
Go get the chop (Chop, chop, chop, chop)"

This is a story I hate
And tellin' it might make me break
But I'll tell it anyway
This chapter's about
How you said there was nobody else
Then you got up and went to her house
You guys always left me out

I still have the letter you wrote when you told me
That I was the only girl you'd ever want in your life
I guess my friends were right

Each day goes by and each night, I cry
Somebody saw you with her last night
You gave me your word, ""Don't worry 'bout her""
You might love her now, but you loved me first
Said you'd never hurt me, but here we are
Oh, you swore on every star
How could you be so reckless with my heart?

You check in and out
Of my heart like a hotel
And she must be perfect, oh well
I hope you both go to hell

You can't buy time with your money
And you love goin' to the beach whether it's cloudy or sunny
And you love drinkin' all your wine until it hurts in your tummy
You call me, ""Honey, I'm tipsy, and really all I want is for you to love me""
Flashbacks of back roads, drivin' back to my side of state
I know I need to tell you I care before it's too late
Before someone steps to the plate, before you decide not to wait
Before you decide not to chase, still you call me up just to say

To sing along to my stereo (Gym Class Heroes, baby!)

If I was just another dusty record on the shelf
Would you blow me off and play me like everybody else?
If I asked you to scratch my back, could you manage that?
Like yikky-yeah check it, Travie, I can handle that
Furthermore, I apologize for any skipping tracks
It's just the last girl that played me left a couple cracks
I used to, used to, used to, used to, now I'm over that
'Cause holding grudges over love is ancient artifacts

If I could only find a note to make you understand
I’d sing it softly in your ear and grab you by the hand
Just keep me stuck inside your head like your favorite tune

And all I ask is that you don't get mad at me
When you have to purchase mad D batteries
Appreciate every mixtape your friends make
You never know, we come and go like on the interstate (Never know)

I think I finally found a note to make you understand

I only pray you never leave me behind (Never leave me)

Ra-Ra-Rasputin, lover of the Russian Queen
There was a cat that really was gone
Ra-Ra-Rasputin, Russia's greatest love machine
It was a shame how he carried on

He ruled the Russian land and never mind the Tsar
But the kazachok, he danced really wunderbar
In all affairs of state, he was the man to please
But he was real great when he had a girl to squeeze
For the Queen, he was no wheeler dealer
Though she'd heard the things he'd done
She believed he was a holy healer
Who would heal her son

Ra-Ra-Rasputin, lover of the Russian Queen
There was a cat that really was gone
Ra-Ra-Rasputin, Russia's greatest love machine

But when his drinking and lusting and his hunger for power
Became known to more and more people
The demands to do something about this outrageous man became louder and louder

""This man's just gotta go"", declared his enemies
But the ladies begged, ""Don't you try to do it, please""
No doubt this Rasputin had lots of hidden charms
Though he was a brute, they just fell into his arms
Then one night, some men of higher standing
Set a trap, they're not to blame
""Come to visit us"", they kept demanding
And he really came

Ra-Ra-Rasputin, lover of the Russian Queen
They put some poison into his wine
Ra-Ra-Rasputin, Russia's greatest love machine
He drank it all and he said, ""I feel fine""
Ra-Ra-Rasputin, lover of the Russian Queen
They didn't quit, they wanted his head

And so they shot him 'til he was dead

From all the sunlight of our past
But she's so sweet, she's so pretty
Does she mean you forgot about me?

Oh, I hope you're happy
But not like how you were with me
I'm selfish, I know, I can't let you go
So find someone great, but don't find no one better
I hope you're happy, but don't be happier

And do you tell her she's the most beautiful girl you've ever seen?
An eternal love bullshit you know you'll never mean
Remember when I believed
You meant it when you said it first to me?
And now I'm pickin' her apart
Like cuttin' her down will make you miss my wretched heart
But she's beautiful, she looks kind
She probably gives you butterflies

I hope you're happy
But not like how you were with me
I'm selfish, I know, I can't let you go
So find someone great, but don't find no one better
I hope you're happy
I wish you all the best, really
Say you love her, baby, just not like you loved me
And think of me fondly when your hands are on her
I hope you're happy, but don't be happier

You're up, then you're down (Down)

Someone call the doctor
Got a case of a love bipolar
Stuck on a roller coaster
Can't get off this ride

You change your mind
Like a girl changes clothes

'Cause you're hot, then you're cold
You're yes, then you're no
You're in, then you're out

Every time the sun goes down, I let you take control
I can feel the paradise before my world implodes
And tonight had something wonderful

My bad habits lead to late nights endin' alone
Conversations with a stranger I barely know
Swearin' this'll be the last, but it probably won't
I got nothin' left to lose, or use, or do
My bad habits lead to wide eyes starin' at space
And I know I lose control of the things that I say
Yeah, I was lookin' for a way out, now I can't escape
Nothin' happens after two, it's truе, it's true
My bad habits lead to you

Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
My bad habits lead to you
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
My bad habits lеad to you

Every pure intention ends when the good times start
Fallin' over everything to reach the first time's spark
It started under neon lights and then it all got dark
I only know how to go too far

My bad habits lead to late nights endin' alone
Conversations with a stranger I barely know
Swearin' this'll be the last, but it probably won't
I got nothin' left to lose, or use, or do
My bad habits lead to wide eyes starin' at space
And I know I lose control of the things that I say
Yeah, I was lookin' for a way out, now I can't escape
Nothin' happens after two, it's true, it's true
My bad habits lead to you

Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
My bad habits lead to you
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

We took the long way 'round
And burned till the fun ran out, now

My bad habits lead to late nights endin' alone
Conversations with a stranger I barely know
Swearin' this'll be the last, but it probably won't
I got nothin' left to lose, or use, or do

This time
Cuz i know, all of the wild shit that’s running through your mind
How you focus on your flaws, even though you look divine
Getting ready trying seven outfits on seven times
And always go with the first one
But that’s the shit i smile bout
Like when i think back to my first time up at your father house
Sneaking past the cameras, i shouldn’t have been in your fathers house
Christmas at your Nona house
Helping her set up that lil elf on the tree
Conversations wit your family about what you gone be
You always end up mad cuz they steady giving warnings
And that ain't what you wanted
You want someone supportive of what you wanted to be
Well girl you always got me
And right here imma stand
Ten toes imma be
NYC fashion week
Watching you strut down the runway
They say the devil wear Prada you trynna walk for them someday
Rain you love when its thunder
But catch a glow when its sunny
Almost three years past 20
Im starting to feel a lil funny
I always hungered for money
But now my stomach is grumbling
My heart is searching for something
Along the lines of the lover
Around you i start to stutter
Im usually smoother than butter, but damn
Shit
Hopefully I see you sooner than later but
If its gotta be later i guess it’s best if its at one of them fashion weeks you feel me

Got a motel and built a fort out of sheets
I finally found you, my missing puzzle piece

And stay awake our whole life

Are you just a dream?
I'll let you see me with my skin untied
We'll make the most of the dying light
Then swim away with the heavenly

Listening to niggas, niggas with them attitudes

Tickle you with my knife, then I drag it down the middle

Cut it, lunge it in your gullet
My obsession with death is whatever you call it...

I pity the poor fool, her
Fruitless in a holster and clueless in a kiss
I'm older than death
Vulgar with unfresh breath
During sex I might put us in some joke positions
But it's scary always how we end up in mission
Like the daring men who fight to submission
Barely conscious there to care about the split decision
Your sour thoughts you wield at me
You wring out your melon
But it yields only drops like an unripe lemon
All a man can understand is your bad intentions
The less you talk the more you draw and seal an ending
Keep leafing through the glossary
Sitting there puffing weed
Telling me repeatedly all the things you want to be
The thug's just a boy once my money in the bags
Is your love but a ploy like Bugs Bunny in drag?
I leave my lungs open, exposed to the whole crew
While you sneak a bump and smoke cloves in the coat room
Itching like a local ho
Wishing like Pinocchio
The wind is at my back anew
But still I feel the lack of you
Oh, you were so heavy in my heart, boo
That soon no longer could my true heart hold you
And like the angular Etruscan tchotchke my mom got me
At the Met gift shop in '92
Tearing from the brown paper bag I kept it in when it was new
After I left it overnight when it was wet with dew
It sounds blue and shitty
But of course kid, like the little skinny bronze horse did
You fell through
You were like a buoy I put down in open ocean
But with no cross staff and no compass in my possession
And too far out for a lighthouse to provide discretion
How could I presume that you'd divine direction
Must have patience
Accept no imitations
Take no paper hearts and fucking hate carnations
Though my home is vacant
Yeah I'm lonesome while I wait
That's no open invitation made to hope we make acquaintance
The long walks home from the laundromat
In Pop-Pop's Holden Caulfield hat
Alone, lost for certain
Dry and pent
Dead bent like a merchant ivory gent
Yes, to yet get a spouse and kids
Have a house full
But I'm hard to be around
And sterile as a roused mule

None of these hoes sayin' shit to my face
And none of these hoes finna see me at the bank
And I'ma keep talkin' all the shit that I want
And I dare one of these hoes come tell me I can't
We ain't even speakin' if the nigga ain't spendin'
He could never say that I was one of his women
I don't even let niggas know where I stay

Shut the fuck—, I mean, please don't talk

If it's good to me, if it's good to me

Joy and pain
Joy and pain, sun and rain
Light will shine
Light will shine, please be mine

And no walls will fence me in
For my mind's a boundless thing
Walls may keep my body here
But my mind can take me there
You can tell me truth or lie
Sell your soul and soon you'll be
The demons in your mind

Joy and pain
Joy and pain, sun and rain
Light will shine
Light will shinе, please be minе

Bitches say they fuckin' with me, chances are they probably not
If I had a dick, you'd probably lick it like a lollipop
Hoes speakin' cap-enese, hit 'em with karate chop
I'm forever poppin' shit, pullin' up and droppin' shit
Gotta argue with him 'cause a nigga love a toxic bitch
Niggas out here playin', gotta make 'em understand

Bitches ain't fuckin' with me now and I can see why
Dirty-ass, dusty-ass bitch, you got pink eye
Bitches want smoke until I bring it to they doorstep
Tell that bitch back back, breath smell like horse sex (Ha)
Put it on him now, he will never be the same (He won't)
Tatted on my ass 'cause I really like the pain (Ah)
He nutted on my butt, I said, ""I'm glad that you came""
If that nigga had a twin, I would let 'em run a train (Skrrt)

This is gonna sound like a bad joke

And I know it sounds so old
But Cupid got me in a chokehold
And I'm afraid I might give in
Towel's on the mat, my white flag is wavin' (Mbabarara)
I mean, she even cooks me pancakes
And Alka-Seltzer when my tummy aches
If that ain't love then I don't know what love is

She's got porcelain skin, of course she's a ten

Йеа, жизнь
Жизнь — единственное, в чём мы нуждаемся
Им же нужно избавиться от меня, но я не хочу уходить
Покойся с миром, Лил Кид

Нахуй голубятню, я — сова, совершенно другой уровень
Мог бы заставить её набить шестёрку на мизинце
Слышал, ты фанатеешь по баскетболу, просто дай мне знать
Будешь сидеть на играх в первом ряду, а не в далеке
Всё впоряде, детка, по крайней мере, сейчас
Не хочу стрессовать из-за суки, ведь скромности у меня не отнять
Ещё я готовлю амбиции прямо на кухонной плите
Травка уже кипит, смотри на пенку, хорошо пойдёт
Шлюхи говорят я обходителен, поэтому не попаду в лапы RICO
Бро считает себя Джоном Уэйном, купил ему жёлтых камней
Мне нравятся их тусовочки, детка, на хуй силикон
Все люди сейчас фейковые, ты могла бы разгадать мой шифр
Всё покрою брюликами и розовым золотом
Говорю с вами на языке дредов, словно Джей Коул
Могу сказать её минет хорош перед тем, как это узнать
Сучка, не строй из себя модель, если не была на обложке Vogue
Нужно замутить вечеринку для самых близких
Они не пишут рэп, но могли бы выдать пару строк
Покойся с миром, Драма Кинг, мы с тобой умели показать стиль
Не нравится, как я говорю? Ниггер, скажи сам чё-то
Нужно замутить вечеринку для самых близких
Подьезжаем и ты узнаешь нас, басс бомбит нехило
Не нравится, как я говорю? Скажи сам чё-то
Убирайся с моего пути, ниггер

Нужно замутить вечеринку для самых близких
Они не пишут рэп, но могли бы выдать пару строк
Покойся с миром, Драма Кинг, мы с тобой умели показать стиль
Если я позволю нигге 21 зачитать, то ты станешь
Ссыклом
Проехал по району дважды, будто парковаться негде (21)
Выписал ему подзатыльник, будто сделал это Барту (Ссыкло)
OVO 4L, мы выходим только ночью (21, 21)
Местный решала приехал на Роллсе, уехал на носилках (21)
Мой брат держит руль, пока я стреляю, командная работа (21)
Задаёшь много вопросов, сука, не строй с себя Надеску
Ствол любит ощущать оппов, мой растлитель (21)
Я со своей пушкой, как Розей с лимонным перцем
Ей хочется услышать афробит, ведь она закинулась Теслой
Весь на воркауте, ниггер представляет, что он рестлер
Но это не UFC, мой ствол шьёт, будто с компрессора (21)
Мой ствол шьёт, будто с компрессора (Ссыкло)
Мой ствол шьёт, будто с— (Ссыкло)
Мой Глок 45 шьёт с переключателем (21)
На месте Уилл Смита я врезал бы ему пушкой
Поднимай руки вверх, это ограбление (21)
Езжу по району, где мне сосут хуй (Факт)
Если хочешь вести здесь свои дела, то придётся брать ствол (21, 21)
А то бегаешь вокруг в страхе, подбери своё дерьмо (21)
Влюбился так, что голова идёт кругом, вот как я кручусь на районе (21)
Безумно люблю своего Boy'я, мой брат-близнец (21)
Если ниггеры продолжат диссить, то налетим опять на них (21)
Мы — причина, почему у оппов нет друзей (21)
Последний, кто хотел поиграть со мной, стал призраком
Я не зароллил его в Woods, ведь он заплесневел уже
Ты спрашиваешь, как её дела, я только что сказал прийти ей и заняться сексом
Выстрелил в него двадцать раз, блять, ниггер везунчик (Блять, ниггер везунчик)

Нужно замутить вечеринку для самых близких
Они не пишут рэп, но могли бы выдать пару строк
Покойся с миром, Драма Кинг, мы с тобой умели показать стиль
Не нравится, как я говорю? Нигга, скажи сам чё-то

Скажи сам чё-то, скажи сам чё-то, скажи сам чё-то, скажи сам чё-то, скажи сам чё-то
Не нравится, как я говорю? Нигга, скажи сам чё-то, скажи сам чё-то, скажи сам чё-то, скажи сам чё-то, скажи сам чё-то"

Fever in a shock wave
My core vibrates in an opium haze
Yet you think we're the same

The skyline falls as I try to make sense of it all
I thought I'd uncovered your secrets but, turns out, there's more
You adored me before
Oh, my good looking boy

Play casino holes of my eyeballs
Roll the dice on my thighs
You stopped for breath and I sped up
Just to impress you

The skyline falls as I try to make sense of it all
I thought I'd uncovered your secrets but, turns out, there's more
You adored me before
Oh, my good looking boy

My good looking boy
My good looking boy
My good looking boy
Oh, my good looking boy

You're not who you are to anyone, to anyone
You're not who you are to anyone, to anyone, these days
I'm not who I am to anyone, no, not me at all
I'm not who I am to anyone these days, not at all

The skyline falls as I try to make sense of it all
(Not to anyone, anyone, anyone)
I thought I'd uncovered your secrets but, turns out, there's more
(Not to anyone, anyone, anyone)
(Not to anyone, anyone, anyone)
You adored me before
Oh, my good looking boy"
